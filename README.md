# Modulo

This repository contains the source code that was extracted from [my Pull Request on the Elixir core language](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/5112).

It adds the `Modulo.mod/2` macro, which is a guard-safe implementation of the floored remainder operation.

Read the blog article I wrote about it [here](https://medium.com/@W_Mcode/down-the-rabbit-hole-defining-a-guard-safe-modulo-operation-in-elixir-6335ade7c078#.jx5phcwv9).
